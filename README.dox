A basic stack crawler in C to check the current caller stack and parse
the functions array based on the formatting specifications to indentify
current stack state and behaviour

It was a good warm up project after 213 last semester. Also rekindled some of
my concepts. Most importantly it made me realise that unlike 213, a lot of the
design decisions, in this course are left upto me and thats really awesome.
